# MikieLyons-Conversions-in-Rugby
Sports Analytics

For my Sports Analytics I have chosen to discuss the Optimal point from which to score a Conversion in Rugby. Of course there are a few
different approaches to completing this but I have chosen to study Crilly & Pryor's work where they opted to create a trade off between 
the distance of the kick and the area which is visible to the kicker.
